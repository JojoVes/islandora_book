# Book Solution Pack

## Introduction

Allows for the creation of book and page objects (islandora:bookCModel,
islandora:pageCModel). Books are essentially a collection of pages, containing
only metadata and optionally a PDF file of the book. A book's PDF can be
generated from each page. Pages are based on an uploaded tiff of the page. From
the uploaded TIFF its possible to generate images for use in the "Islandora
Internet Archive Bookreader". It is also possible to generate PDF files per
page. OCR and OCR coordinate data can also be generated from the uploaded TIFF.

### Known Issues

* **Islandora Book MODS Form**: In August 2018, a bug in the Book MODS form
was identified and fixed. The form's **ISBN** element was set to READ all
instances of any MODS identifier element, but to CREATE identifiers with the
'type="isbn"' attribute. When editing an object with this form, the form would
create a new copy of every identifier element regardless of attributes, which
may have led users to remove those identifiers. Any objects edited using this
form before the August 2018 fix should be reviewed to ensure their metadata is
correct.
